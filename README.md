About the project
=================
Domus is an interactive web prototype (build with HTML/CSS only), that allows users to manage their automation stuff, like lights, shutters or sockets.
It was created for an HCI educational project in Grenoble, France in 2011, by [Anthony Nemoff](http://anemoff.com/) and me.
